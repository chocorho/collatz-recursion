# Collatz-Recursion
Provides a small library for those that cannot access my private server to reach reasources I used including CSV files and python scripts to graph and gather data on the Collatz Conjecture 

## Notes
Most of the code is hastily written and uncommented, it is neither optimized nor intuitive. The aim of this was to just the barebones data to write my report.
